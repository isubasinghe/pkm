# Operating System

# Networking versus Distributed OS

### Networked OS

A networked operating system provides support for network operations. The users manage the networked applications and commands. Each host is autonomous.

### Distributed OS

Tries to abstract the network from the user and thereby remove the need for the user to specify how the networking commands and operations should be undertaken.
