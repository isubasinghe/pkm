# Soren Kierkegaard

> I opened my eyes and saw the real world - and I began to laugh and I haven't stopped since.

## Meaningless

Laugh at the world's foolishness and you'll regret it, cry at the world's foolishness and you'll regret it. **The ony intelligent response to life's horror is to laugh at it**

## The Concept of Anxiety

Life can only be understood backwards, but made forwards. Our constant angst mean unhappiness is more or less written into the script of life.
