## Le Peste (The Plague)

Oran is an ordinary town. Dr.Rio comes across dead rats, soon the town is overcome by hordes of dead rats. Something is afoot. Soon an epidemic siezes Oran. Camus was not writing about one plague in particular. Camus was referring to the plague we all suffer from, death itself. The actual historical events we call plagues are simply accelerations of this already exisiting plague. **Our lives are fundementally absurd**

### Ourselves

Like the residents of Oran, we assume we have immortality to this plague and with this naivity come behaviours Camus abhored.

* Hardness of heart.
* Obsession of status
* Judgement.
