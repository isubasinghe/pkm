# AntiSymmetry

In mathematics, a homogeneous relation **R** on set X is antisymmetric if there is no pair of distinct elements of X each of which is related by **R** to the other. More formally, **R** is antisymmetric precisely if for all a and b in X.

If R\(a,b\) holds then R\(b,a\) must not hold

or equivalently: if R\(a,b\) == R\(b,a\) then a==b
