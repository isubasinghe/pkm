# FLP result
Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process
The problem of consensus is known to have a solution under a
synchronous network. The FLP result shows that in an asynchronous setting, 
where only one processor might crash, there is no distributed algorithm that solves the 
consensus problem.
