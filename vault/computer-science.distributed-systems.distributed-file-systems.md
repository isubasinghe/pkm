# Distributed File Systems

## Why are distributed file systems hard?
Distributed systems need performance

* Performance `fixedBy` Sharding
* Sharding `introduces` Faults
* Faults `fixedBy` Tolerance 
* Tolerance `requires` Replication 
* Replication `introduces` Inconsistencies
* Inconsistencies `introduces` Low performance
